# Change Tracking System - AssetTRAC

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING SYSTEM

### Recent Session Changes (2025-10-05)
1. **Fixed invitation disappearing issue** - Root cause: automatic status updates in home page
2. **Implemented proper invitation lifecycle** - email_confirmed → admin_approved → completed
3. **Improved admin dashboard** - Shows all non-completed invitations in one section
4. **Enhanced user experience** - Concise messages and email admin button
5. **Fixed activity logging** - Only first logins appear in recent activity

## Critical Files & Their Current State

### Core Invitation Flow
- `pages/api/invite/accept/index.ts` - ✅ Creates user account, sets status to email_confirmed
- `pages/api/admin/approve-user/index.ts` - ✅ Sets status to admin_approved
- `pages/api/auth/signin/index.ts` - ✅ Sets status to completed (only if admin_approved)
- `pages/index.tsx` - ✅ FIXED: No longer auto-updates invitation status

### Admin Dashboard
- `pages/admin/dashboard/index.tsx` - ✅ Shows email_confirmed + admin_approved in "Invitation Management"
- `pages/admin/dashboard/index.tsx` - ✅ Shows completed in "Manage Users"

### User Experience
- `pages/company/create.tsx` - ✅ Redirects to /auth?message=waiting_approval
- `pages/auth/index.tsx` - ✅ Shows concise message + email admin button

## Invitation Lifecycle (DO NOT BREAK)

```
1. Admin sends invitation → Status: pending
2. User accepts invitation → Status: email_confirmed
3. User creates company → Status: still email_confirmed
4. Admin approves → Status: admin_approved
5. User logs in → Status: completed
```

## Critical Dependencies

### Status Transitions (MUST MAINTAIN)
- `email_confirmed` → `admin_approved` (admin action only)
- `admin_approved` → `completed` (user login only)
- `email_confirmed` → `rejected` (admin action only)

### Dashboard Filtering (MUST MAINTAIN)
- "Invitation Management": Shows status !== 'completed'
- "Manage Users": Shows status === 'completed'

### API Dependencies (MUST MAINTAIN)
- signin API only marks as completed if status === 'admin_approved'
- home page does NOT auto-update invitation status
- admin approval API sets status to 'admin_approved'

## Testing Protocol

### Before Any Changes
1. Document current working state
2. Test complete invitation flow
3. Verify admin dashboard displays correctly
4. Check that invitations don't disappear prematurely

### After Any Changes
1. Test admin sends invitation
2. Test user accepts invitation
3. Test user creates company
4. Test admin approves user
5. Test user logs in
6. Verify invitation moves to "Manage Users"

### Critical Path Test
```
Admin → Send Invitation → User Accepts → User Creates Company → 
Admin Sees in "Invitation Management" → Admin Approves → 
User Sees "Email Admin" Button → User Logs In → 
Invitation Moves to "Manage Users"
```

## Rollback Strategy

### If Invitations Disappear Too Early
- Check `pages/index.tsx` for automatic status updates
- Check `pages/api/auth/signin/index.ts` for premature completion

### If Admin Can't See Invitations
- Check `pages/admin/dashboard/index.tsx` filtering logic
- Verify status transitions in approval API

### If User Can't Login After Approval
- Check `pages/api/auth/signin/index.ts` approval status check
- Verify profile is_approved field is set correctly

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Invitations stay visible until admin approval
- ✅ Admin can approve/deny invitations
- ✅ Users can login after admin approval
- ✅ Invitations move to "Manage Users" after first login
- ✅ Activity logging shows only first logins
- ✅ Users can email admin for approval

## Next Session Checklist
1. Test complete invitation flow end-to-end
2. Verify all status transitions work correctly
3. Check admin dashboard displays properly
4. Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
5. Update this document with any new changes
