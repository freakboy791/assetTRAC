**Purpose**: Asset management for SMBs  
**Repository**: GitHub assetTRAC  
**Current Status**: Development phase with core authentication and invitation system implemented

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Project Cleanliness Policy
**NEVER** add test files, debug files, temporary folders, or troubleshooting files to this project. 

### Strict Rules:
- ❌ **NO** `.sql` files for testing

### Permission Clarifications

#### Management vs View Permissions
- **Management Access**: Can create, read, update, and delete data
- **View Access**: Can only read/view data (no create, update, delete)

#### Asset Access
- **Full CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete assets
- **Read-only**: View asset information only

#### Financials Access  
- **Full CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete financial data
- **Read-only**: View financial reports and data only

### Implementation Details

#### Helper Functions
```typescript
// Check if user can manage company (admin, owner, manager)
const canManageCompany = () => {
  return userRoles.includes('admin') || userRoles.includes('owner') || userRoles.includes('manager')
}

// Check if user should see company recap (tech, viewer)
const shouldShowCompanyRecap = () => {
  return userRoles.includes('viewer') || userRoles.includes('tech')
}

// Check if user can edit company
const canEditCompany = () => {
  return isAdmin || isOwner || isManager
}
```

#### Role Storage
- **Session Storage**: `userRoles` array, `isAdmin`, `isOwner` flags
- **User Metadata**: Fallback role information in Supabase user metadata
- **Database**: Role information stored in `company_users` table

#### UI State Management
- **Edit Mode Toggle**: `isEditing` state controls form field states
- **Role-Based Rendering**: Conditional rendering based on user roles
- **Dynamic Styling**: Form fields styled differently based on edit permissions

## Database Schema (Current Implementation)

### Tables

#### 1. `profiles`
```sql
- id: uuid (Primary Key, references auth.users.id)
- email: text (NOT NULL)
- first_name: text (nullable)
- last_name: text (nullable)
- is_approved: boolean (default: FALSE)
- approved_by: uuid (nullable)
- approved_at: timestamp with time zone (nullable)
- email_verified: boolean (default: FALSE)

```

```

#### 5. `invites`
```sql
- id: uuid (Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid())
- company_id: uuid (references companies.id)
- invited_email: text (NOT NULL)
- role: text (NOT NULL)
- created_by: uuid (nullable)
- accepted: boolean (default: FALSE)
- created_at: timestamp with time zone (default: now())

- email_confirmed_at: timestamp with time zone (nullable)
- admin_approved_at: timestamp with time zone (nullable)
- admin_approved_by: uuid (nullable)
- completed_at: timestamp with time zone (nullable)
```

#### 6. `activity_logs` ✅ **ACTIVE**
```sql
- id: uuid (Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid())
- user_id: uuid (nullable, references auth.users.id)
- user_email: text (NOT NULL)
- company_id: uuid (nullable, references companies.id) -- For company-specific activities
- action: text (NOT NULL) -- 'user_approved', 'user_login', 'invitation_sent', 'invitation_accepted', 'invitation_completed', etc.
- description: text (NOT NULL) -- Human-readable description
- metadata: jsonb (nullable) -- Additional data about the event
- created_at: timestamp with time zone (default: now())
```

**Usage**: This table stores system activity logs for audit trails and dashboard display. Activities are logged via `lib/activityLogger.ts` and displayed in the Recent Activity section of dashboards. Sample data includes invitation events, user approvals, and completion activities.

**Event Tracking & Filtering System**:

**Event Tracking (Who Initiates Each Event)**:
| Event | Who Gets Credit | Where Logged |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Company Created** | Person creating company | `pages/api/company/create/index.ts` |
| **Invitation Sent** | Person sending invite | `pages/api/send-invite-email/index.ts` |
| **Invitation Accepted** | Person accepting invite | `pages/api/invite/accept/index.ts` |
| **User Approved** | Admin approving user | `pages/api/admin/approve-user/index.ts` |
| **Invitation Completed** | Person completing process | `pages/index.tsx` |
| **User Login** | Person logging in | `pages/index.tsx` |

**Dashboard Filtering (Who Sees What)**:
| Role | What They See in "Recent Activity" |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| **Admin** | 🔍 **All Events** (except user logins) - Can see everything |
| **Owner** | 👤 **Only Own Events** - Just their personal actions |
| **Manager** | 👤 **Only Own Events** - Just their personal actions |
| **Viewer/Tech** | 👤 **Only Own Events** - Just their personal actions |

**How It Works**:
1. **Event Logging**: Every action logs the `user_email` of who performed it
2. **Database Storage**: Events stored in `activity_logs` table with proper initiator tracking
3. **Role-Based Filtering**: Each dashboard filters events based on user's role and email
4. **Personal Privacy**: Non-admin users only see their own activities

**Example Scenarios**:
- **Admin Dashboard**: Sees all events (invitation sent, user approved, company created) except user logins
- **Owner Dashboard**: Sees only their own events (company created, invitations they sent) but not admin approvals
- **Manager/Viewer/Tech**: See only their personal activities

#### 7. `admin_notifications`
```sql
- id: integer (Primary Key, auto-increment)
- type: text (NOT NULL)
- user_id: uuid (nullable)
- company_id: uuid (references companies.id)
- message: text (NOT NULL)
- is_read: boolean (default: FALSE)
- created_at: timestamp with time zone (default: now())
```

#### 7. `user_roles`
```sql
- id: uuid (Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid())
- user_id: uuid (nullable)
- role: text (NOT NULL)
- created_at: timestamp with time zone (default: now())
```

### Key Observations

#### Current vs Planned Schema Differences:
1. **`profiles` table**: Missing `company_name` and `role` fields (stored in `company_users` instead)
2. **`invites` table**: Uses `uuid` for `id` instead of `serial`, has additional fields like `accepted`
3. **`assets` table**: Uses `type` instead of `category`, `cost` instead of `purchase_price`
4. **`companies` table**: Missing `description` and `website` fields, has address fields split into `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip`
5. **Additional tables**: `admin_notifications`, `user_roles`, and `activity_logs` exist in current implementation
6. **`activity_logs` table**: ✅ **ACTIVE** - Stores system activity logs for audit trails and dashboard display

#### Foreign Key Relationships:
- `company_users.company_id` → `companies.id`
- `invites.company_id` → `companies.id`
- `admin_notifications.company_id` → `companies.id`
- `assets.assigned_to` → `profiles.id`

#### Default Values:
- UUIDs: `gen_random_uuid()` for most primary keys
- Timestamps: `now()` for created_at fields
- Booleans: `FALSE` for approval/verification flags
- Status fields: `'active'` for assets, `'pending'` for invites
